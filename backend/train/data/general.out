QUESTION:
Can I transfer credits from another university to my graduate program?

ANSWER:
Students who wish to take a course at another university, with the intention of
transferring, should obtain the approval of their advisor and graduate school
prior to enrolling in the course to ensure that they meet the transfer
requirements.

CONTEXT:
[1] External to UNH: The transfer credit request must be recommended by the program
faculty and approved by the Graduate School. Current UNH graduate students who
wish to take a course at another university, with the intention of transferring,
should obtain the approval of their advisor and graduate school prior to
enrolling in the course to ensure that the course meets the transfer
requirements.

[2] External to UNH: Students may request that a maximum of two courses, for up to 8
credits of graduate level coursework, from an accredited institution authorized
to grant graduate degrees, be transferred to count toward their graduate
program. Courses must be at the graduate level and cannot have been used or be
in the process of being used in earning another graduate degree or certificate
or have been taken while completing a bachelor's degree. A grade of B or better
must have been earned. Students must submit an External Transfer Credit Form to
request that the credits be applied to their degree requirements.

[3] Credit Transfer: A maximum of 12 credits taken by a student prior to
matriculation (internal and external combined) can be applied to a degree
program. Transfer credits must be formally approved and appear on the UNH
transcript in order for them to count towards the degree requirements.

applied to their degree requirements.

================================================================================

QUESTION:
What happens if I miss too many classes?

ANSWER:
Students are not penalized for missed assignments or missed class. In these
cases, faculty have discretion regarding what flexibility to offer based on
their syllabus policies. If a student is called for required military service or
jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period and render
them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of the course
as determined by the instructor.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: Reasons that faculty must excuse student absences are: (a)
participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[2] Attendance: Reasons that faculty may excuse student absences include: (a) ill
health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when
students are representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-
related opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class.

[3] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[4] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.

[5] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

A graduate student may, with the approval of his or her adviser and the faculty
member concerned, audit courses. The deadline for requesting an audit is listed
on the Registrar's calendar.

CONTEXT:
[1] Auditing Courses: A graduate student may, with the approval of his or her
adviser and the faculty member concerned, audit courses. The deadline for
requesting an audit is listed on the Registrar's calendar. Subsequent requests
for change to audit require a petition form and must be approved by the course
faculty member, the student's adviser, graduate program coordinator, and the
dean of the Graduate School. Courses taken by graduate students for audit are
charged at the same rate as for-credit courses.

[2] Grades: Audit Grades: An "AU" grade is assigned for completion of courses for
which an audit was granted. No credit is earned.

[3] Grades: Pass/Fail Grades: Graduate courses cannot be taken pass/fail. A graduate
student may petition to take undergraduate courses on a pass/fail basis. Such a
petition must be approved by the end of the add period for the term the course
is taken. Courses at the 700-­level approved for graduate credit cannot be taken
for pass/fail.

[4] Admission: An official final transcript showing final grades and the awarding of
the degree must be received by the Graduate School before the student may enroll
for the graduate program. Transcripts from all previous post-secondary
institutions must be submitted and applicants must disclose any previous
academic or disciplinary sanctions that resulted in their temporary or permanent
separation from a previous post-secondary institution. If it is found that
previous academic or disciplinary separations were not disclosed, applicants may
face denial and admitted students may face dismissal from their academic
program.

[5] Summer Session: Although many graduate ­level courses are offered during the
summer session, the University does not guarantee that any particular course
will be offered. The availability of individual faculty members to supervise
research or to participate in qualifying examinations and final examinations or
defenses during the summer session varies from year to year.

QUESTION:
What should I do if I need to withdraw from a course?

ANSWER:
A student may request to withdraw from their graduate degree program during any
semester by obtaining a withdrawal form from the Graduate School website.
Students who formally withdraw are required to apply for readmission if they
subsequently desire to resume their academic program.

CONTEXT:
[1] Grades: W Grades: If a student, for compelling nonacademic reasons, submits an
approved petition to drop a course during the withdrawal period, a notation of
"W" will be shown on the student's academic record. The specific withdrawal
deadlines can be found on the UNH Academic Calendar. Failure to officially
withdraw will result in an AF grade, which is maintained on the official student
record and included in the grade point average (GPA). Not attending classes does
not constitute an automatic withdrawal.

[2] Certificate Programs: Only courses completed with a grade of B- or higher may be
used to fulfill certificate requirements. A student who receives more than one
grade below B- will be required to withdraw from the certificate program.

[3] Withdrawal: A student may request to fully withdraw from their graduate degree
program during any semester by obtaining a withdrawal form from the Graduate
School website. Students who formally withdraw are required to apply for
readmission if they subsequently desire to resume their academic program.
Students who are applying for readmission are required to pay an application fee
plus, if readmitted, any accumulated continuing enrollment fees for the period
during which they have been inactive. Students are not guaranteed readmission
and may be evaluated in competition with current applicants to the program.

[4] Dual Degrees: If the student withdraws from one of the participating programs,
the dual-degree arrangement is automatically nullified.

[5] Readmission: Students who withdraw, who have their degree status discontinued,
or whose time limit has expired and subsequently desire to resume their academic
program, are required to apply for readmission. Readmission forms are available
at the Graduate School's website. Students who are applying for readmission are
required to pay an application fee plus, if readmitted, any accumulated
continuing enrollment fees for the period during which they have been inactive.
Students are not guaranteed readmission and may be evaluated in competition with
current applicants to the program.

QUESTION:
What happens if I get an incomplete grade?

ANSWER:
An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or a petition for an
extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This policy also
applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved
leave of absence.

CONTEXT:
[1] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.

CONTEXT:
[1] Leave of Absence: Students who, because of extenuating circumstances, are unable
to pursue their graduate program may request a leave of absence for a maximum of
one calendar year. Such circumstances may include medical reasons, military
obligation, family emergencies, or hardship. The procedure for an approved leave
of absence requires that students submit a request, available at the Graduate
School's website, along with appropriate documentation, prior to the term for
which the leave is requested. The dean of the Graduate School, upon
recommendation of the student's adviser and graduate program coordinator, will
review the request. If the request for a leave is granted, the time limit for
completion of the student's program will be extended appropriately. Students on
an approved leave of absence are exempt from paying the continuing enrollment
fee. Graduate students who do not return from a leave of absence in the allotted
time frame will have their degree status discontinued.

[2] Degree Status Discontinued: Students who do not formally withdraw and do not
register and pay for course credits, research, or continuing enrollment by the
appropriate registration deadline, or do not return from an approved leave of
absence, will have their degree status discontinued. Students are notified by
the Graduate School when this administrative action is taken and are required to
apply for readmission or reinstatement if they subsequently desire to resume
their academic program.

[3] Master's Time Limit: All graduate work for any master's degree must normally be
completed within four years from the date of matriculation (enrollment following
admission) in the program. Progress toward the degree will be carefully
monitored by the advisor and the Graduate School to ensure that adequate
advancement is made toward the completion of the program and that any
deficiencies noted at the time of admission are removed. Students failing to
make adequate advancement toward completion of the program are subject to
dismissal in advance of the four-year time limit. Extensions to the four-year
time limit will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Years on leave do not
count toward the time limit.

[4] Continuous Registration Policy: Unless a leave of absence is granted, graduate
students enrolled in face to face programs are required to maintain continuous
enrollment each semester of the academic year until their degree is formally
awarded by registering for course credits, research, or continuing enrollment.
Students who do not maintain continuous enrollment as required will have their
degree status discontinued and will no longer be active in the degree. Students
will need to petition for reinstatement or readmission in order to return to
their program.

QUESTION:
What's the difference between an M.S. and M.A. degree?

ANSWER:
The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-level courses (9-12 graduate
credits) be in an area of subject matter concentration rather than in education.
Students who have previously completed a baccalaureate degree at UNH or another
institution may also apply to the teacher preparation program at the graduate
level.

CONTEXT:
[1] Degree Requirements: An M.S. degree is conferred upon successful completion of a
program of not less than 30 credits for natural resources and the environment
options: forestry, environmental conservation and sustainability, environmental
economics, ecosystem science, and wildlife and conservation biology.

[2] Sociology (M.A.): The master's program emphasizes Sociological theory and
methods. Some students earn the M.A. to prepare for positions as applied
sociologists. Their work often includes field experience. Others view the M.A.
degree as preparation for Ph.D. studies. An M.A. thesis or publishable paper
describes results from the student's own original research.

[3] Secondary Education (M.A.T.): What is the difference between an M.Ed. and the
M.A.T in Secondary Education? The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-
level courses (9-12 graduate credits) be in an area of subject matter
concentration rather than in education. UNH undergraduates completing a
baccalaureate degree outside of education who are interested in the M.Ed. or
M.A.T. in Secondary Education can begin preparation for teaching at the
undergraduate level with a semester of field experience and professional course
work in education. In their second semester junior year or first semester senior
year, qualified students can apply to the Accelerated Master’s Program . If
accepted, they can potentially complete both their bachelor’s and master’s
degrees in as few as five years. Students who have previously completed a
baccalaureate degree at UNH or another institution may also apply to the teacher
preparation program at the graduate level. Without prior course work in
education, these programs will normally require two years to achieve licensure
and a degree.

[4] Secondary Education (M.Ed.): What is the difference between an M.Ed. and the
M.A.T in Secondary Education? The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-
level courses (9-12 graduate credits) be in an area of subject matter
concentration rather than in education. UNH undergraduates completing a
baccalaureate degree outside of education who are interested in the M.Ed. or
M.A.T. in Secondary Education can begin preparation for teaching at the
undergraduate level with a semester of field experience and professional course
work in education. In their second semester junior year or first semester senior
year, qualified students can apply to the Accelerated Master’s Program . If
accepted, they can potentially complete both their bachelor’s and master’s
degrees in as few as five years. Students who have previously completed a
baccalaureate degree at UNH or another institution may also apply to the teacher
preparation program at the graduate level. Without prior course work in
education, these programs will normally require two years to achieve licensure
and a degree.

[5] Degrees Offered: Ph.D., M.S.: The M.S. program provides students with the
opportunity to develop a high degree of proficiency in a specialized research
area. The program builds a solid foundation for careers in industry or teaching,
for further graduate or professional school, or for those who would like to
strengthen their Chemistry knowledge.

a source of intellectual capital for the University, the region, and the nation.

[4] Interdisciplinary Programs: The Graduate School encourages and supports
interdisciplinary study within existing programs and in the form of new and
innovative graduate curricula. While self­-designed courses of study are not
available at the University, many of our programs offer a range of electives,
cross­-disciplinary study, and independent projects that allow students to
tailor their work to reflect individual interests. This is especially true at
the doctoral level. In addition, the Graduate School oversees intercollegiate
programs that involve faculty and coursework from more than one school or
college. Intercollegiate programs offer students the opportunity to pursue new
and emerging fields of study that draw upon multiple disciplines, leading to
solid disciplinary foundations as well as cross­-disciplinary skills useful for
solving new social and scientific problems. Opportunities for interdisciplinary
research are also available in the institutes and centers at the University.

examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the instructor, be
penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work missed.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: Reasons that faculty may excuse student absences include: (a) ill
health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when
students are representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-
related opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class.

[2] Attendance: Reasons that faculty must excuse student absences are: (a)
participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[3] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.

[4] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

[5] Attendance: Absences from examination and laboratory periods

[4] Policy and Procedure for Program Dismissals: This procedure is not applicable to
graduate students who have received failing grades in 9 or more credits since
dismissal is automatic in that case (see Academic Standards section.)

[5] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.
