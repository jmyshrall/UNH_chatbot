QUESTION:
What is the repeat rule for MARI 895?

ANSWER:
The same applies to students who have failed grades in 9 or more credits since
dismissal is automatic in that case (see Academic Standards section).

CONTEXT:
[1] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[2] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.

[3] Student Load for Veterans Benefits: 3/8 credit/week or more = 3/4 time

[4] Student Load for Veterans Benefits: 1/4 credit/week or more = 1/2 time

[5] Policy and Procedure for Program Dismissals: This procedure is not applicable to
graduate students who have received failing grades in 9 or more credits since

QUESTION:
What is the repeat rule for EDC 844?

ANSWER:
Students who withdraw from the University or who are on an approved leave of
absence will have to take a course that is repeated once.

CONTEXT:
[1] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[2] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.

[3] Doctoral Time Limits: The DNP, OTD, Ed.S., and Ed.D degrees must be completed
within 4 years.

[4] Examinations: Examinations at the end of each semester may be given in any
course, but all such examinations must be scheduled and given at the time they
are scheduled with the following exceptions: practical examinations covering
laboratory work may be given during the last five days of classes preceding the
examination period. In courses of a modular nature with several instructors, the
instructor of the final module may schedule a final examination during the last
week of classes if approval is first obtained from the college dean. These
exceptions apart, no announced oral or written test may be given during the last
five days of classes preceding the examination period. If a student is scheduled
for more than two final exams in one day and chooses to take only two final
exams on that day, the middle exam will be rescheduled. The instructor, in
consultation with the student, will schedule a makeup exam.

QUESTION:
What's the repeat rule for JUST 899?

ANSWER:
The same applies to graduate students who have received failing grades in 9 or
more credits since dismissal is automatic in that case.

CONTEXT:
[1] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[2] Student Load for Veterans Benefits: 3/8 credit/week or more = 3/4 time

[3] Graduate Courses: Graduate credits may be earned in courses numbered from 800
through 999, or under limited circumstances in courses numbered at the 700
level.

[4] Grades: Incomplete Grades: An "IC" grade is assigned with the approval of the
instructor for excused unfinished work only. The work must be completed and
submitted to the instructor by the date agreed upon with the instructor, but not
later than the last day of classes of the semester immediately following the one
in which the incomplete was granted (800-­ and 900-level courses only; mid-
semester deadline for 400-­, 500-, 600-, and 700-­level courses). If
extraordinary circumstances arise, a petition requesting additional time may be
submitted. The petition, listing a specific deadline for completion, must be
approved by the instructor, the student's adviser, and graduate program
coordinator before being submitted to the Graduate School. An extension will be
granted by the dean only under unusual circumstances and will usually not exceed
one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course was
originally taken. An incomplete grade becomes an "F" if not resolved or if a
petition for an extension is not approved within the allotted time period. This
policy also applies to students who withdraw from the University or who are on
an approved leave of absence.

[5] Policy and Procedure for Program Dismissals: This procedure is not applicable to
graduate students who have received failing grades in 9 or more credits since
dismissal is automatic in that case (see Academic Standards section.)
