QUESTION:
Can I transfer credits from another university to my graduate program?

ANSWER:
A maximum of 12 credits taken by a student prior to matriculation (internal and
external combined) can be applied to a degree program. Transfer credits must be
formally approved and appear on the UNH transcript in order for them to count
towards the degree requirements.

CONTEXT:
[1] External to UNH: The transfer credit request must be recommended by the program
faculty and approved by the Graduate School. Current UNH graduate students who
wish to take a course at another university, with the intention of transferring,
should obtain the approval of their advisor and graduate school prior to
enrolling in the course to ensure that the course meets the transfer
requirements.

[2] External to UNH: Students may request that a maximum of two courses, for up to 8
credits of graduate level coursework, from an accredited institution authorized
to grant graduate degrees, be transferred to count toward their graduate
program. Courses must be at the graduate level and cannot have been used or be
in the process of being used in earning another graduate degree or certificate

================================================================================

QUESTION:
What happens if I miss too many classes?

ANSWER:
Graduate students are expected to attend all classes and laboratory sessions.
Faculty members are required to keep attendance records. Absence from class may
result in course failure regardless of the reason for the absence. Students who
must be absent from class should contact their instructors as soon as possible.

CONTEXT:
[1] Attendance: Reasons that faculty must excuse student absences are: (a)
participation in official intercollegiate events, (b) participation in official
adaptive sports events facilitated by Northeast Passage, (c) jury duty, (d)
required military service, and (e) important religious holidays and/or
observances. In these cases, it is expected that students are not penalized for
missed assignments or missed class. Faculty may still set expectations regarding
how students make up missed work and learn missed content. Faculty may also
request documentation regarding official intercollegiate events, required
military service, and jury duty. If a student is called for required military
service or jury duty that will cause them to miss class for an extended period
and render them unable to adequately fulfill the standards and requirements of
the course as determined by the instructor, that student should contact the
associate dean of the Graduate School to discuss options to drop or withdraw.

[2] Attendance: Reasons that faculty may excuse student absences include: (a) ill
health, (b) personal emergencies, and (c) instructional trips, and (d) when
students are representing UNH in regional, national, and international academic-
related opportunities. In these cases, faculty have discretion regarding what
flexibility to offer based on their syllabus policies. Students may contact the
Dean of Students if they’re managing a temporary, extenuating circumstance that
will affect their academics for an ongoing period to request that a notice be
sent to their faculty. These notices will not be sent in situations where
students are missing only one or two days of class.

[3] Grades: Repeated courses: Repeating a course does not remove the original course
or grade from the record. If the course numbers and/or titles do not match
exactly, graduate students must obtain written permission of their adviser,
graduate program coordinator, and the endorsement of the Graduate School dean
before the adjustment will be made. Only the most recent grade is included in
the cumulative grade-­point average, and only the most recent credit, if any, is
included in the cumulative credits earned. A course may only be repeated once.
Only repeated courses taken at UNH will alter the cumulative grade-­point
average. Failing a required course for a second time is grounds for dismissal.

[4] Attendance: Specific attendance requirements including how individual faculty
assess absences and designate excused absences are set by the course instructor
based on the needs of the course. Individual course attendance policies are
described in the course syllabus. Students should contact their faculty
regarding any circumstances, including illness, which will require them to stay
home and/or which will cause them to be unable to keep up with course activities
and expectations. Students should also be prepared to reach out and proactively
ask faculty if they are unsure of what is expected of them in the course, as
related to their absences or in general.

[5] Attendance: Any student who is absent without excuse from an announced test,
quiz, examination, or laboratory period may, at the discretion of the
instructor, be penalized for such absence or be allowed to make up the work
missed.

completion of the student's program will be extended appropriately. Students on
an approved leave of absence are exempt from paying the continuing enrollment
fee. Graduate students who do not return from a leave of absence in the allotted
time frame will have their degree status discontinued.

[2] Degree Status Discontinued: Students who do not formally withdraw and do not
register and pay for course credits, research, or continuing enrollment by the
appropriate registration deadline, or do not return from an approved leave of
absence, will have their degree status discontinued. Students are notified by
the Graduate School when this administrative action is taken and are required to
apply for readmission or reinstatement if they subsequently desire to resume
their academic program.

[3] Master's Time Limit: All graduate work for any master's degree must normally be
completed within four years from the date of matriculation (enrollment following
admission) in the program. Progress toward the degree will be carefully
monitored by the advisor and the Graduate School to ensure that adequate

QUESTION:
What's the difference between an M.S. and M.A. degree?

ANSWER:
M.S. (Master of Science) degrees are typically offered in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics fields, while M.A. (Master of Arts) degrees are
usually in liberal arts, humanities, and social sciences. The specific
requirements and focus may vary between programs.

CONTEXT:
[1] Degree Requirements: Educational Specialist Degree

[2] Sociology (M.A.): The master's program emphasizes Sociological theory and
methods. Some students earn the M.A. to prepare for positions as applied
sociologists. Their work often includes field experience. Others view the M.A.
degree as preparation for Ph.D. studies. An M.A. thesis or publishable paper
describes results from the student's own original research.

[3] Secondary Education (M.Ed.): What is the difference between an M.Ed. and the
M.A.T in Secondary Education? The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-
level courses (9-12 graduate credits) be in an area of subject matter
concentration rather than in education. UNH undergraduates completing a
baccalaureate degree outside of education who are interested in the M.Ed. or
M.A.T. in Secondary Education can begin preparation for teaching at the
undergraduate level with a semester of field experience and professional course
work in education. In their second semester junior year or first semester senior
year, qualified students can apply to the Accelerated Master’s Program . If
accepted, they can potentially complete both their bachelor’s and master’s
degrees in as few as five years. Students who have previously completed a
baccalaureate degree at UNH or another institution may also apply to the teacher
preparation program at the graduate level. Without prior course work in
education, these programs will normally require two years to achieve licensure
and a degree.

[4] Secondary Education (M.A.T.): What is the difference between an M.Ed. and the
M.A.T in Secondary Education? The M.A.T. requires that at least three graduate-
level courses (9-12 graduate credits) be in an area of subject matter
